  [ Hector Martin ]
  * Implement library and device shutdown and clean up USB open somewhat
  * Fix dropped packet count calculation
  * Reject format changes when streams are active
  * Move packed depth buffer sizes to public header
  * Free libusb transfers (fix memory leak)

  * Refactor stream buffering and move bufs to heap
  * Add support for setting user-controlled buffers
  * Use new buffer stuff in glview
  * Move bayer to RGB to a separate function
  * Move tilt code back into tilt.c and rename device_state ->
    tilt_state
  * Make libfreenect endian-independent
  * Rename format/size constants and enums
  * Rename *rgb* functions to *video* + internals
  * Get rid of freenect_[packed_]depth
  * Support IR video stream
  * Rename YUV size constant and add YUV_RGB one for consistency

  [ Jochen Kerdels ]
  * Optimized unpacking of depth data regarding speed and memory
    boundaries

  [ Jochen Kerdels ]
